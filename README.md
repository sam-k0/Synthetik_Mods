# Synthetik_Mods
Work in progess mod repo for Synthetik Arena using YYTK
<br>
Currently there isn't anything here as I started by writing an event manager to use in future plugins.
<br>
# YYTK Usage
1. On GitHub, search for YYToolkit, go to releases and download the latest release "DownloadMe" folder.
2. Extract the archive and start the YYToolkit Launcher.exe
3. Click "Select Runner" and select the Synthetik game executable
4. Right click on "Plugins" and choose "Install Plugin" and select the plugin you downloaded (Plastik.dll)
5. Check "Early Injection" Checkbox (It probably won't work otherwise..)
6. Click "Launch with YYToolkit"
